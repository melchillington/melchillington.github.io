            <p>Super fun photoresistor project. A photoresistor is a light-controlled variable resistor. The
                resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity.
                I used 3 photoresistors to power on and off 3 LEDs. When you wave your hand over any of the three
                resistors, it causes the corrisponding light to power on, and when your hand isn't there they will
                power off. I found this project to be really fun, especially when I found out turning off my nearby
                lamp also made them turn on.<br><br><strong>The parts I used were:</strong>
                Uno, 3 LEDs, 3 10k Ohm resistors for the LEDs, 3 LDR photoresistors, and jumper wires

            <p>This is my attempt at making a Bluetooth Smart door. I cut apart a shoebox to make a door
                and taped
                a latch to it.
                A basic Android app made with MIT app inventor 2 is used to control the Servo motor that is
                connected to the latch via paperclip.<br><br><strong>The parts I used were:</strong>

            <p>Another one of my top favorites. This was supposed to be a smart mirror, however I couldn't
                find a
                two-way mirror anywhere. It is powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. I used an old janky
                monitor
                I had laying around and took it apart, the only thing it is missing is the mirror.<br><br><strong>The
                    parts I used were:</strong>
                old monitor, VGA-HDMI dongle, RPI3 model B. rip two way mirror :(

            <p>A continuation of my distance project, with the addition of an LCD. I took out the flashing
                lights
                and buzzer and
                added a visual representaiton of the distance between an object (my hand), and the sensor.

            <p>Arduino uno distance radar. When an object is close to the sensor, the buzzer will go off
                and the
                LED's will begin to flash with respect to how close the object is. For example, the closer
                the
                object is, the buzzer will be louder and the red LEDs will light up. When the object gets
                further
                and further away, the sound gets softer & the LEDs go towards the green, indicating the
                object
                isn't close. Notice I had to use blue LEDs in place of yellow ones because I didn't have
                them on
                hand at the time. <br><br><strong>The parts I used were:</strong>
                Arduino uno, 6 LEDs, resistors, jumper wires, piezo speaker & HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance

            <p>This was my final project for my CS 298 Embedded Systems course. It was by far my favorite
                class &
                project I have made to date. I chose to do my project based on the best show --"The
                Office". I
                presented 10 questions on the LCD screen that the user could answer. The user had two push
                buttons,
                one for true, the other for false. If the user got the right answer to a question, the
                green LED
                would flash & their score would increment by 1. If they got it wrong, the red LED would
                flash &
                their score stayed the same.
                At the end of the game, the user would be presented with their final score, a max of 10
                pts. <br><br><strong>The
                    parts I used were:</strong>
                Arduino nano, jumper wires, potentiometer resistors, LEDs, and LCD screen.
